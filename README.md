<img src="https://github.com/acheamponge/Schitts_Creek/blob/master/Images/7.jpg" align="middle">


A Natural Language Processing project focused on The Schitt's Creek television show.

In this project, I decided to utilize the NLP API on the Google Cloud Platform instead of using open source modules.

### - Some Issues you might encounter
- Installing google-cloud does not work you have to specifically install google-cloud-language in order to get the import module to work
- In order to get access to the Google NLP API, you need the credentials or else it won't work. I set it as a variable in my code but there are other ways to do it.
